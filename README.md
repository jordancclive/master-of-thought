# About Master of Thought
Master of Thought is an extension of the book As a Man Thinketh, by James Allen. This project is being developed in conjunction with <a href="http://learnerinterests.com/">Learner Interests</a>, a resource to help parents raise lifelong learners, because parents cannot raise lifelong learners interested in self-mastery without themselves being committed to the same. There is no better place to start than one's own tools of thought. Though this site's inspiration came from helping parents pursue lifelong learning with their children, it is applicable to everyone equally.
