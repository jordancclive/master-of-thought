<blockquote>
  Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-59) came to America in 1831 to see what a great republic was like. What struck him most was the countryâ€™s equality of conditions, its democracy. The book he wrote on his return to France, Democracy in America, is both the best ever written on democracy and the best ever written on America. It remains the most often quoted book about the United States, not only because it has something to interest and please everyone, but also because it has something to teach everyone.
