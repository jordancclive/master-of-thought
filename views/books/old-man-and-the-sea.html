  Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal â€” a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss.
