<blockquote>
  A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em> becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions on how to live. The narratorâ€™s relationship with his son leads to a powerful self-reckoning; the craft of motorcycle maintenance leads to an austerely beautiful process for reconciling science, religion, and humanism. Resonant with the confusions of existence, this classic is a touching and transcendent book of life.
